One of the oldest bookstores in Nepal serving since 1961 A.D, Educational Enterprise is a nationally recognized bookseller, distributor, and publisher. We’re passionate about promoting reading culture – and it goes way beyond just selling books.

At Educational Enterprise, providing access to education material to help our customer expand their knowledge is a way of life. We don’t believe age, gender or past actions define you, only your ambition and desire for wholeness... today.

We differentiate ourselves through a combination of unique book selection merged with unequaled standards of quality and authenticity.
